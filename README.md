Print a binary tree by vertical level order, like: 1 2 4 3 5 print : 3 2 1 5 4.
Simple heap search algorithm implementation.
How would you find out the number of cars passing on a busy bridge?
Standard rotated binary search question. You have a sorted array that has been shifted/cycled, perform a search on it
Retrieve words from a dictionary that are made up of a subsequence of characters in an input string (i.e. given input "ABAT," matching words may include "BAT" and "TAB" while non-matching words may be "BART" or "BAR").
Add 2 binary numbers (input as a string).
What is a memory-efficient way to store a vector of integers? Follow-up question: using your proposed data structure, find an algorithm with constant memory usage to calculate the dot product of two vectors.
Print a binary tree in level order. Then print the tree in level order, but using DFS
Obj-C: 5 multiple choice questions.
Be familiar with NSSet and NSOrderedSet. These data structures are more performant than NSArrays for some operations.
Display the sorted output of a merge of any number of sorted arrays. Then do it again, but more efficiently.
Get the n-th Fibonacci number
Find the depth of a binary tree
Merge two arrays
Reverse a doubly linked list.
3 sum and pow().
Reverse string pair words that are anagrams of each other.
Given an array of integers, find three that sum to a given value. Alternately, find all triplets that sum to the given value.
Implement an asked simple function on an empty paper. Each type of variable (ex. int, double) and conditional/iterative statement has to be chosen carefully
Implement a square root function.
Find all possible permutations for a string and find an element's position in a slightly sorted array in the most efficient way (you have something like [5,6,7,1,2,3] and you want the position for "2" -> you use a binary search algorithm).
Shortest route between airports.
Design a system to detect homework copying, which means input two strings and a integer K, if there is a common substring of them having a length larger than K, return true, otherwise return false.
Build a dictionary trie and implement search functions, mainly focusing on the OO designing pattern.
Implement strstr(), and a follow up question is how to speed it up.
If you could change something about Facebook, what would it be?
Find the minimum in a rotated sorted array and find the minimum element. Assume no duplicate exists in the array.
Move all non-zero elements into the front of the array.
Regex matching.
1--a 2--b â€¦ 26--z given a digit, return the count of the possible output eg. '1313' --- 4 acac mac mm acm '101' --1 ja cannot discard any digit.
Given a matrix, calculate the sum of a sub matrix given the start and end indices of the submatrix.
